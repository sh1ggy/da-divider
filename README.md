This is the monorepo for Divider, a group-shared bill splitting platform. 

## About
This project was made to address a personal gap in our friend group where the onus of the bill splitting calculations had to be on the one who paid the whole bill. The approach with this project is to instead make the bill splitting process more communal and socially active wherein users would opt into whichever items that they contributed to whilst also keeping the experience frictionless, with a shared group login model. 

## Structure
This is our project's current repo structure, the names being based off pudding-type desserts.
