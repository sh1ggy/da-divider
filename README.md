This is the front-end repo for Divider, a group-shared bill splitting platform. 
## About
This project was made to address a personal gap in our friend group where the onus of the bill splitting calculations had to be on the one who paid the whole bill. The approach with this project is to instead make the bill splitting process more communal and socially active wherein users would opt into whichever items that they contributed to whilst also keeping the experience frictionless, with a shared group login model. 

## Stack
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/), our chosen front-end JS framework. 
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) our chosen UI plugin TailwindCSS component library
## Development
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
