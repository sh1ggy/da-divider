This is the front-end repo for Divider, a group-shared bill splitting platform. 

## Stack
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/), our chosen front-end JS framework. 
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) our chosen UI plugin TailwindCSS component library
## Development
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
